# Creating-plots-with-pandas
Since a picture is worth a thousand words, plots and graphs can be very effective in communicating a clear description of the data, especially when disclosing findings to an audience or sharing the data. with other DSs.
In this case, I generated some random data before creating my first basic figures. Then, added that random data to a pandas Series.
No need for details cuz it's just basic right:)
